Intro_15 = One day, he was stoped by the God of Gods : The Great Caribou.
Intro_16 = He sealed the evil Elk into the void, preventing him from spreading chaos.
Intro_17 = At least, that's what the legend said...
Intro_18 = Across the ages, many people tried to summon Lord Elk back, with little success.
Intro_19 = This sect seemed one more attempt to resurect a long gone entity.
Intro_20 = The rumors died down. Who cared about a strange sect in the mountains anyway ?
Intro_21 = Until...
Intro_22 = ...The old fortress exploded with no warning.
Intro_23 = The province was thrown into confusion, as nobody claimed the attack.
Intro_24 = Some claimed the sect failed their summoning of Lord Elk.
Intro_25 = Some claimed that a vigilante came and put a stop to their operation.
Intro_26 = In the end, nobody really knew. It could have been either of those. Maybe even both.
Intro_27 = But this was only an interlude for a coming storm.

Intro_98 = It's my grimoire ! My summoning grimoire !
Intro_99 = Within it's page lies the secrets to summoning people into our world.
Intro_100 = You do understand the gravity of the situation, right ?
Intro_101 = If it falls into the wrong hands, it could be used to summon dangerous beings in this world.
Intro_102 = Oh. I see. Quite the pickle indeed...
Intro_103 = And who stole your book ? Do they still have it ?
Intro_104 = Well... How should I say it ?
Intro_105 = Maybe you should see for yourself...
Intro_106 = Harold's motions me towards his television.

Intro_130 = So you want me to go and win it for you ?
Intro_131 = Please, [MC]. You are my only hope !
Intro_132 = Okay, okay. But what did you do to make him so angry ?
Intro_133 = Well... It's a long story.
Intro_134 = But all you need to know is that Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand, went crazy.
Intro_135 = He didn't do well financialy last year, so the park went in decline.
Intro_136 = About a week ago, he snapped and decided to "invite" everyone in the province to come to his park.
Intro_137 = No doubt in a desperate attempt to gain money.
Intro_138 = And the crown jewel in his scheme is the prize, my grimoire.
Intro_139 = It doesn't seem like he knows it's secrets. For now at least...
Intro_140 = So I'll have to win it before he figures out it's not just a plain old book.
