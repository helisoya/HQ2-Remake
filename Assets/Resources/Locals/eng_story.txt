Intro_2 = It is so calm, you could think almost nothing ever happen here.
Intro_3 = However, deep in the mountains, a mystery is afoot.
Intro_4 = What was once the domain of a terrible dragon, is now unoccupied.
Intro_5 = Some people tried to claim it for themselves, but failed.
Intro_6 = Rumors says a man came, and defeated them all.
Intro_7 = No one really knew who he was, or what he looked like.
Intro_8 = But thanks to him, the late dragon's domain and its treasure remained untouched.
Intro_9 = However, things did not stop here.
Intro_10 = Rumors resurfaced. They told of a strange sect residing in the old fortress.
Intro_11 = Who were they ? What was their goal ? People could only speculate...
Intro_12 = They seemed to worship a dangerous god, Lord Elk.
Intro_13 = In the local faith, he is the god of chaos and destruction.
Intro_14 = He was said to have walked this land, bringing about chaos everywhere he went.
Intro_15 = One day, he was stoped by the God of Gods : The Great Caribou.
Intro_16 = He sealed the evil Elk into the void, preventing him from spreading chaos.
Intro_17 = At least, that's what the legend said...
Intro_18 = Across the ages, many people tried to summon Lord Elk back, with little success.
Intro_19 = This sect seemed one more attempt to resurect a long gone entity.
Intro_20 = The rumors died down. Who cared about a strange sect in the mountains anyway ?
Intro_21 = Until...
Intro_22 = ...The old fortress exploded with no warning.
Intro_23 = The province was thrown into confusion, as nobody claimed the attack.
Intro_24 = Some claimed the sect failed their summoning of Lord Elk.
Intro_25 = Some claimed that a vigilante came and put a stop to their operation.
Intro_26 = In the end, nobody really knew. It could have been either of those. Maybe even both.
Intro_27 = But this was only an interlude for a coming storm.
Intro_28 = A storm so fierce, it could swallow the entire continent. 
Intro_29 = And at the center of it, a single person.

Intro_38 = Wh- Where am I ?
Intro_39 = I had a wierd dream... What was that ?
Intro_40 = Wait... I'm back, aren't I ?
Intro_41 = This is Vlatyr, Harold summoned me again...
Intro_42 = I thought it was over now. Can't I catch a break ?
Intro_43 = ...... Actually, where am I ?
Intro_44 = This isn't Harold's house. This is a lake.
Intro_45 = Now how do I find his house ? I don't remember where it is.
Intro_46 = A moving shadow catches my attention.
Intro_47 = Who's there ?!
Intro_48 = .......
Intro_49 = It seems I was wro-
Intro_50 = Hey lad, do you know the difference between a human and an ash grouse ?
Intro_51 = ...Hu ...Humans can't fly ?
Intro_52 = What ? You don't know the difference ? Me too !
Intro_53 = So, that makes you an Ash grouse. And I love to hunt ash grouses !
Intro_54 = Wait, what ?
Intro_55 = Die, little grouse !
Intro_56 = The hunter aims his rifle at me. I start running away.

Intro_57 = ...... I think I managed to get away....

Intro_61 = I approch the house and knock on the door.
Intro_62 = .....
Intro_63 = After a few minutes, the door opens.

Intro_68 = I thought the summoning failed... I got worried you see.
Intro_69 = Last time I failed one, well...
Intro_70 = ... Well I'm here now.
Intro_71 = So what's the situation ? Why did you summon me back ?
Intro_72 = I thought we agreed that I would stay on my world.
Intro_73 = Yes, well... I'm sorry, really.
Intro_74 = It's just, I am in trouble. And I figured only you could help me !
Intro_75 = Alright, alright... Tell me what happened this time...
Intro_76 = But please, no more lies. I'm not risking my life for some keys again.
Intro_77 = Well, in that case. I have good news and bad news.
Intro_78 = But we'll discuss this inside. Come.
Intro_79 = I follow Harold inside his house.
Intro_80 = It barely changed. I wonder how long it has been.
Intro_81 = How l-
Intro_82 = It has been one year, [MC]. One long year.
Intro_83 = Everything went quiet after you defeated the dragon.
Intro_84 = We've had some minor problems around a week after you left.

Intro_86 = You ? Going on a quest by yourself ?
Intro_87 = Well... Let's just say I had help.
Intro_88 = Right... What about the good and the bad news you said you had ?
Intro_89 = Oh, of course. Well...
Intro_90 = The bad news is that someone stole my belongings again.
Intro_91 = And the good news ?

Intro_93 = ............
Intro_94 = ............
Intro_95 = I said something funny again, didn't I ?
Intro_96 = Yes you did...
Intro_97 = Oh, but wait ! It's not any book !
Intro_98 = It's my grimoire ! My summoning grimoire !
Intro_99 = Within it's page lies the secrets to summoning people into our world.
Intro_100 = You do understand the gravity of the situation, right ?
Intro_101 = If it falls into the wrong hands, it could be used to summon dangerous beings in this world.
Intro_102 = Oh. I see. Quite the pickle indeed...
Intro_103 = And who stole your book ? Do they still have it ?
Intro_104 = Well... How should I say it ?
Intro_105 = Maybe you should see for yourself...
Intro_106 = Harold's motions me towards his television.
Intro_107 = He turns it on, and changes the channel to a... peculiar one...

Intro_108 = Have you ever dreamed of going to an amazing park ?

Intro_125 = And if I don't see you there.... I'LL END Y-

Intro_126 = .............
Intro_127 = What did I just see ?
Intro_128 = It's RickeyLand. You went to the park last time, remember ?
Intro_129 = And well... The prize book he showed... It's my grimoire.
Intro_130 = So you want me to go and win it for you ?
Intro_131 = Please, [MC]. You are my only hope !
Intro_132 = Okay, okay. But what did you do to make him so angry ?
Intro_133 = Well... It's a long story.
Intro_134 = But all you need to know is that Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand, went crazy.
Intro_135 = He didn't do well financialy last year, so the park went in decline.
Intro_136 = About a week ago, he snapped and decided to "invite" everyone in the province to come to his park.
Intro_137 = No doubt in a desperate attempt to gain money.
Intro_138 = And the crown jewel in his scheme is the prize, my grimoire.
Intro_139 = It doesn't seem like he knows it's secrets. For now at least...
Intro_140 = So I'll have to win it before he figures out it's not just a plain old book.
Intro_141 = Yes. But you'll have to wait until morning to gain access to the park.
Intro_142 = Please, feel free to use my bedroom for the night.
Intro_143 = I owe you at least that.
Intro_144 = Thank you, Harold.
Intro_145 = And so I decided to rest for the night.
Intro_146 = When the morning came, I decided to start my quest.
Intro_147 = Well, at least it's warmer now that the sun is up...
Intro_148 = I should head to RickeyLand now. The sooner I get this done, the sooner I get home.

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ------------------- Marais ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Swamp_Intro_1 = Vlatyr's Swamp, uh...
Swamp_Intro_2 = So, the archer is somewhere here.
Swamp_Intro_3 = Time to find the man. I can't let him attack the fortress.

Swamp_ArcherQuest1_1 = After walking for a bit, I manage to find a bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_2 = Someone is currently on it, watching the opposite side of the river.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_3 = Is he the archer ? Time to find out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_4 = I approach him. He seems to notice me, and turns around.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_5 = Why, hello there.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_6 = I'm the great archer. I'm sure you heard of my heroic tales.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_7 = Killer of the swamp's ogre, great hunter, and more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_8 = But let's not talk about that other guy and the dragon. I'm the important one, okay ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_9 = But what brings you here ? Oh, I know !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_10 = You need protection ? Are you too afraid to walk in the streets ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_11 = I can help with that ! I can protect you from any danger.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_12 = Hum, no. I don't recquire your services.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_13 = Such a fierce stare... You are different.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_14 = You... are a rival. Are you not ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_15 = Why did you come here ? Do you want to challenge me, the great archer ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_16 = You are planing to attack the Braise Fortress. I can't let you do that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_17 = Attack ? What a joke ! I'm only going to visit it for a bit.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_18 = You know, I'll walk in its empty corridors, filling my pockets with precious artefacts.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_19 = I was told they were quite potent. I'm quite excited.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_20 = With them, I'll be unstopable ! I'll be able to be the greatest archer ever !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_21 = No more will I be ridiculed by unarmed civilians ! No more !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_22 = I will hunt the greatest games. I'll become a legend !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_23 = I'm not going to allow this. Surrender while you can.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_24 = Surrender ? I am an archer, and you ? You have nothing !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_25 = Some ropes won't help you defeat someone like me !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_26 = The archer does a backflip, and disapears in a tree.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_27 = Where is he ? I can't see him anymore.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_28 = You think you can prevent my ascension to legend ? Dodge that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_29 = Suddenly, I hear a arrow being shot from a tree not far from me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_30 = I barely have enough time to dodge it, but I manage it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_31 = He fires again, from a different tree. Again, I barely dodge it. 
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_32 = I have to get out of here. I can't fight him like that.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_33 = I run away. He doesn't seem to be following me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_34 = Now, how should I deal with him ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_35 = I need a gun, but apparently they were all sold out.
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_36 = .... Maybe the weird hunter can help me. If he can shoot...
Swamp_ArcherQuest1_37 = I should be able to find him at his house.

Swamp_ArcherQuest3_1 = Ah. There you are, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_2 = I thought I saw the bloody archer here, but I was wrong.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_3 = There are only trees and rocks over here...
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_4 = I wonder where the bastard went. I have to teach him a lesson.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_5 = Follow me. I can guide you where I saw him last time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_6 = But be ready. I almost died back then.
Swamp_ArcherQuest3_7 = Don't worry about me. I'm right behind you, lad.    

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_1 = We manage to get back to the bridge.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_2 = But where is the archer ? It would be annoying if he went away.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_3 = Where is the bloody grouse killer ? WHERE ARE YOU ?!
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_4 = Don't yell. I'm here.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_5 = His voice comes from the trees. He's still hiding.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_6 = So you brought a friend ? Were you scared ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_7 = Show yourself ! Let us fight !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_8 = Ah ! I know my weaknesses. I won't make such a mistake.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_9 = If you want to fight, you'll have to do it like that !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_10 = Get down !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_11 = We hear an arrow being shot. I get down. It barely missed me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_12 = Why you little... You won't be able to climb trees when I'll be done with you !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_13 = Lad ! Help me spot him. I'll take the shot.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_14 = He thinks he's the best shot here... He doesn't know me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_15 = This is for the Ash Grouses !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_16 = We get ready to hunt the archer. 

Swamp_ArcherQuest4_17 = Argh !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_18 = The archer falls to the ground. We did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_19 = Well ! That was refreshing ! Nice job, lad.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_20 = You know what, I'll leave the rest to you.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_21 = All this firing made me hungry for grouses.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_22 = If you need me again. Come see me at my house.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_23 = Now then, if you'll excuse me...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_24 = The hunter leaves. Perfect.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_25 = Now I'll be able to deal with the archer however I want.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_26 = I approche him. He's trying to get up.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_27 = Y- You... You defeated me... again...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_28 = Why do I always get bested by unarmed civilians ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_29 = First that guy killed the dragon, now you... Why does this keep happening ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_30 = Why did you want to pillage the fortress ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_31 = I only wanted a little bit of fame. I only wanted to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_32 = Wherever I go, everybody keep their distance with me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_33 = So I thought that maybe, if I was famous, they would talk to me.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_34 = I came here, and killed the swamp's ogre. But alas...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_35 = It seems fame wasn't the only thing I required in order to be liked...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_36 = Soon afterwards, Lord Ember was killed in his fortress.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_37 = I had heard that the fortress contained various artefacts. Some of wich are very potent.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_38 = So I set out to enter the now empty fortress to find artefacts. In hope that one could solve my problem.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_39 = ... I don't think an artefact can help you with that...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_40 = Whatever. Just promise you won't pillage it. Or there won't be another time.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_41 = O- Of course ! I promise !
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_42 = Great. Now move. I don't have all night.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_43 = The archer crosses the bridge and exits the swamp.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_44 = Well... I did it.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_45 = I let him go, since he was so pathetic...
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_46 = Well then. Time to deal with Rickey, the CEO of RickeyLand.
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_47 = He should be in his amusement park. But who know for how long ?
Swamp_ArcherQuest4_48 = I could be too late. I have to hurry.

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherGone_2 = Now I'll be able to forage mushrooms in peace.

Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_1 = Hey, you. Have you seen an archer around here ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_2 = Uh ? Oh, hello. Why, yes. I know an archer who lives here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_3 = He lives in this house, right here.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_4 = The old man points to the left house. Perfect.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_5 = But if you want to meet him, you're out of luck.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_6 = He went to the swamp about an hour ago. He said something about "training before the expedition".
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_7 = Great... Now I'll have to search the swamp for him.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_8 = But why do want to meet him, if I may ?
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_9 = He's.... about to do a mistake. And I have to prevent that.   
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_10 = I see. This boy sure is troublesome. 
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_11 = Ever since he killed that ogre, he's bragging all day about it.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_12 = He even forbade me from entering the swamp without him. What a joke.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_13 = Interresting... I'll talk to him about that.
Swamtyr_OldMan_ArcherQuest0_14 = Well, time to search the swamp. I don't have much time.

Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_1 = Now to find this archer... He should be somewhere around here.
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_2 = Maybe the old man can help me.
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_3 = Hey. Where is the archer ?
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_4 = Uh ? Oh. The rascal ran off about 30 minutes ago.
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_5 = He came back from a training session in the swamp, and said "I'm ready to find artefacts !".
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_6 = I don't know what he meant though...
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_7 = Great. This means he's already at the fortress.
Swamtyr_ArcherGoesToFortress_8 = I have to hurry, or else there will be troubles. 

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------- Montagnes ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Mountains_Sign_Default_1 = "House of the great wizard of Vlatyr"
Mountains_Sign_Default_2 = Where is the house ?

Mountains_Car_1 = How did this car end up here ?


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------- Mines ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Mines_MainQuest3_1 = So this is the mine Harold told me about.
Mines_MainQuest3_2 = I should be able to find the quartz he want in there.
Mines_MainQuest3_3 = Let's go. We're short on time.
Mines_MainQuest3_4 = I enter the mines.
Mines_MainQuest3_5 = It's very dark in here. I have to be careful not to get lost.
Mines_MainQuest3_6 = I light up a nearby torch. It will help navigate this maze.
Mines_MainQuest3_7 = Well... Time to find some quartz.

Mines_MainQuest3_8 = I finally found some quartz.
Mines_MainQuest3_9 = Harold should be satisfied now...
Mines_MainQuest3_10 = Well, time to get out of here.
Mines_MainQuest3_11 = I manage to exit the mines after walking for a bit.
Mines_MainQuest3_12 = Alright. Now I should head back to Harold's house.


# ---------------------------------------------------------
# --------------- Forteresse ------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_1 = I finally arrive to the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_2 = But it seems I'm too late... Rickey is already here.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_3 = Ah Ah ! The fortress is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_4 = Hold on ! 
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_5 = Uh ? Who are you ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_6 = Can't you see I'm busy reclaiming this abandoned fortress ? 
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_7 = It doesn't belong to you ! You can't do that.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_8 = What ?! I do as I please ! I'm a CEO !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_9 = What gives you the right to question my authority ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_10 = What is your name, vile monster ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_11 = Hum... Harold.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_12 = I'm not going to give him my real name, that's for sure.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_13 = Harold ! What a stupid name ! I hate it ! I hate you !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_14 = You can't get in my way ! I need to proceed !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_15 = But why ? Are you in debt or something ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_16 = You wouldn't understand ! The economy doesn't too !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_17 = I had it all ! Money, fame.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_18 = But it all disapeared ! It's Natasha's fault, I'm sure !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_19 = "We don't have money anymore. Nobody's even coming to the park." she told me. Lies !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_20 = I can't fail ! It's impossible ! Not after the previous attempts !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_21 = So this failure is a lie ! There is a deeper meaning to it.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_22 = People don't come to my park, they say. You hire too many bodyguards they say. Enough !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_23 = I need these bodyguards ! I need the tanks ! It's security ! Who doesn't like security ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_24 = And if people don't come to my park, it must be a conspiracy !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_25 = They want me to fail ! They're jaleous !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_26 = They're working with the governement, the police, the mountains, EVERYONE !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_27 = All so they can force me to close down my great RickeyLand !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_28 = But I won't let them, no !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_29 = They think they can get me with this "money" thing. They are wrong.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_30 = I'm going to take control of the fortress and its gold.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_31 = I will use the gold to pay whatever "debts" they think I have.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_32 = And I will make this fortress my new HQ. The Grand Rickey Fortress !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_33 = It will strike fear into the conspirators, fear !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_34 = They will stop their plot against me. They will all return to my park !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_35 = They will bend their knees in front of me ! I will be a king, no, an emperor !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_36 = What a load of bullshit ! What are you even talking about ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_37 = Rha ! I knew you wouldn't understand ! You're just a peasant, Harold !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_38 = I hate you ! You must be conspiring with them !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_39 = The conspiracy already knew about my plans ! They sent you to dispose of me !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_40 = But I won't let you ! I'll dispose of you with my tank !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_41 = Prepare for battle, Harold !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_42 = Rickey prepares himself. And I have no weapons...

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_43 = What are you doing, Harold ? Spacing out before a battle ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_44 = Hey... Is that an axe ? When did you get that ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_45 = Whatever ! It's time for you to die !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_46 = I prepare for battle.

Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_47 = Impossible ! How could you defeat me ?!
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_48 = No matter ! I'll just take control of the fortress anyway !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_49 = Rickey starts crossing the bridge in reverse.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_50 = Or at least, he tries to. Due to the size of his tank, he ends up driving off the cliff.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_51 = Uh ? Oh no !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_52 = SOMEONE HELP ! CEO IN DANGER !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Rickey_53 = The tank falls of the cliff. We won't be seeing Rickey anytime soon.


Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_1 = I finally arrive to the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_2 = Where is the archer ? Am I too late after all ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_3 = I suddenly spot him on the bridge. He seems to be coming back from the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_4 = Why hello there ! What are you doing alone in the mountains ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_5 = You are aware that it's quite dangerous out here, especially at night, right ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_6 = Or did you want to meet me, the great Archer ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_7 = I'll have you know, I'm quite the reknowned hunter.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_8 = Nobody surpasses me ! Especially not that dragon killer guy !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_9 = Actually, I'm more interested in what you were doing just now.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_10 = Uh ? Straight to the point, I see.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_11 = Well, you see. I was exploring the fortress. 
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_12 = I found a ton of powerful artefacts in there ! It's so great !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_13 = I'm sure they'll enhance my abilities !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_14 = What ? Why ? You know these things can be dangerous.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_15 = Ah Ah ! Don't worry about me ! I'll be fine !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_16 = Even if I loose an arm, the reward will be worth it. Infinite power !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_17 = You're just crazy. Why are you doing this ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_18 = Crazy, me ? Ah ! Ridiculous !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_19 = I only seek power, strength, and fame.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_20 = People look down on me. They think I'm not worth it. They're wrong !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_21 = I'm the greatest archer ! They are just jaleous of me !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_22 = What are you even talking about ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_23 = Shut it ! I know why you're here.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_24 = You want to steal my artefacts, my fame !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_25 = I won't let you ! They are mine !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_26 = Only I can claim to be the greatest hunter of the continent !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_27 = And I'm going to kill you for your insolence !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_28 = The archer takes a ring out of his pocket, and puts it on.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_29 = Ah Ah Ah ! Perfect !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_30 = Wh- What ?!
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_31 = The archer is now purple. What happened ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_32 = This rings makes me more powerful, maybe even invincible !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_33 = So, you still think you can steal my fame ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_34 = Let's fight, right here, right now.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_35 = The winner can take the artefacts. Eh Eh Eh.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_36 = This is unfair, you are using them to fight !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_37 = Shut up ! Prepare yourself.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_38 = The archer prepares himself. I don't have a weapon though...

Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_39 = What are you doing ? Spacing out before a battle ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_40 = Hey... Is that an axe ? When did you get that ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_41 = Whatever ! It's time for you to die !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_42 = I prepare for battle.

Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_43 = Argh !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_44 = The archer takes a step back. The effects of the ring seem to have worn out.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_45 = However, he trips with moving back and start falling off the cliff.
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_46 = What ?! No !
Fortress_MainQuest2_Archer_47 = I did it.


Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_1 = [MC] ! Can you hear me ?
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_2 = Suddenly, I hear Harold's voice.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_3 = Uh ?!
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_4 = I'm using magic to contact you. I have something for you.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_5 = I don't know how are things on your hand, but I found a weapon for you to use.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_6 = Here !
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_7 = The vision gives me an axe. Now I can fight back.
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_8 = I'm hurrying to the fortress as I speak. Hang tight, [MC] !
Fortress_MainQuest2_HaroldWeapon_9 = Harold disapears.

Fortress_MainQuest3_1 = [MC] ! There you are !
Fortress_MainQuest3_2 = Harold runs up to me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_3 = Where is our ennemy ? Did you already defeat him ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_4 = Yes. He was no match for me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_5 = Thanks for the axe, I guess. It helped a little.
Fortress_MainQuest3_6 = Eh Eh ! Don't be shy. But you're welcome, [MC] !
Fortress_MainQuest3_7 = Thanks to your efforts, peace has been restored to the province.
Fortress_MainQuest3_8 = The CEO and the archer have been defeated. Their plans were thwarted.
Fortress_MainQuest3_9 = I'll be able to sleep easily this night, I believe.
Fortress_MainQuest3_10 = You barely did anything...
Fortress_MainQuest3_11 = Who knows what tragedy would have happened had they taken control of the fortress...
Fortress_MainQuest3_12 = I'm glad you were able to intervene. Really, I am. Thank you so much.
Fortress_MainQuest3_13 = Nobody might know who you are, or what you did tonight. But I do.
Fortress_MainQuest3_14 = Actually... I have a favor to ask.
Fortress_MainQuest3_15 = You see, this isn't the first ordeal the province had to face.
Fortress_MainQuest3_16 = Before that, we had lord Ember. And before him, we had other dangers to face.
Fortress_MainQuest3_17 = When I was younger, I actually fought. Like you, I faced the various ordeals thrown in front of me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_18 = Alas... I got old. I couldn't fight anymore. So I turned to new venues. New ways to face the ordeals.
Fortress_MainQuest3_19 = I learned magic, and I founded a guild of some sort. We are vigilantes in a way.
Fortress_MainQuest3_20 = When an ordeal appears, we fight. Nobody knows who we are. We fight in the shadows, like I used to.
Fortress_MainQuest3_21 = If the ordeal is too much for us, that's when I come in.
Fortress_MainQuest3_22 = I hand pick a hero from another world, and summon him to help us.
Fortress_MainQuest3_23 = With their strength, we never lost even once.
Fortress_MainQuest3_24 = And now, you are that hero, [MC]. I summoned you to help us.
Fortress_MainQuest3_25 = Mr. Boyardee is actually a member of the guild. That why I asked you to meet him.
Fortress_MainQuest3_26 = We provided you assistance, because we knew you could do it.
Fortress_MainQuest3_27 = And now, I've been thinking...
Fortress_MainQuest3_28 = Usually, the heroes want to go back to their own world.
Fortress_MainQuest3_29 = But... I'm sorry, I read a little about your life during my search.
Fortress_MainQuest3_30 = You have nowhere to go, do you ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_31 = ...
Fortress_MainQuest3_32 = What about joining our guild ? It'll be your new home.
Fortress_MainQuest3_33 = We fight the various ordeals the world has to offer.
Fortress_MainQuest3_34 = But at heart, we are a all brothers and sisters. We're a familly.
Fortress_MainQuest3_35 = I could even help you find a place to settle in.
Fortress_MainQuest3_36 = So... What do you say ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_37 = Do you want to join us ?

Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_1 = Alright... I'll join your guild.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_2 = I see. Thank you for trusting me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_3 = Well... Let's go back home for now.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Accept_4 = I'll introduce you to the guild in the afternoon.

Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_1 = No.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_2 = Even if I don't have anywhere to go back in my world. I can't join you.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_3 = There is too much I don't know about this world. Too much I'll miss from mine.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_4 = I see. Well, it's your choice.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_5 = Come, let's get back home.
Fortress_MainQuest3_Refuse_6 = I'll send you back to your world when we get back.

Fortress_MainQuest3_38 = Suddenly, a flash of light blinds me.
Fortress_MainQuest3_39 = When my vision comes back a moment later, I'm speechless.
Fortress_MainQuest3_40 = The fortress is now protected by a magic barrier.
Fortress_MainQuest3_41 = By Lord Elk ! What is this sorcery ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_42 = We defeated Rickey and the archer. What now ? Another contestant ?!
Fortress_MainQuest3_43 = I take it you didn't create the barrier ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_44 = No ! I can't even do that.
Fortress_MainQuest3_45 = Someone else placed it. But for what purpose ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_46 = I did it ! I did it !
Fortress_MainQuest3_47 = No...
Fortress_MainQuest3_48 = A small man appears in front of us, hovering in the air.
Fortress_MainQuest3_49 = You're that wizard that lives in the mountains, right ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_50 = But why ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_51 = I am connected to this fortress. I am married to her !
Fortress_MainQuest3_52 = What ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_53 = Sometime ago, I married Talia. She was the keeper of this place.
Fortress_MainQuest3_54 = But a meanie came and stole her from me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_55 = He even left this world with her ! He stole my wife !
Fortress_MainQuest3_56 = Wait... So that's why I could never find it !
Fortress_MainQuest3_57 = I bet they are currently having a honeymoon together. Talia !
Fortress_MainQuest3_58 = How could she ?! I thought she loved me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_59 = I was so sad ! I was so alone !
Fortress_MainQuest3_60 = My mansion felt so big, yet so small... Sadness !
Fortress_MainQuest3_61 = But then it hit me !
Fortress_MainQuest3_62 = Talia is the keeper of the forteress, and we still haven't filled for divorce.
Fortress_MainQuest3_63 = So technically, the fortress is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest3_64 = It's power is mine ! The orb is mine !
Fortress_MainQuest3_65 = No one can have it ! No one !
Fortress_MainQuest3_66 = So that's why you want the fortress. You want the chaos orb !
Fortress_MainQuest3_67 = I own it ! It's mine ! It will make me strong enough to bring Talia back !
Fortress_MainQuest3_68 = The wizard disapears. I didn't understand a thing.
Fortress_MainQuest3_69 = [MC] ! We are in trouble ! We can't let him use the orb !
Fortress_MainQuest3_70 = Wait, wait, wait. I don't understand. Who's Talia ? What's this orb ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_71 = I... right. You don't know.
Fortress_MainQuest3_72 = Well. Let's start with the orb.
Fortress_MainQuest3_73 = The chaos orb is a powerful artefact hidden in the fortress.
Fortress_MainQuest3_74 = It can do many things, but you can be sure chaos always will ensure.
Fortress_MainQuest3_75 = It was actually the source of power of lord Ember, the dragon.
Fortress_MainQuest3_76 = Ever since his death, I only thought about this orb.
Fortress_MainQuest3_77 = It was safe in the fortress. But if anyone were to take control of it...
Fortress_MainQuest3_78 = They would gain incredible powers. I get it.
Fortress_MainQuest3_79 = Yes. I don't even want to think about a chaos-charged Rickey or archer...
Fortress_MainQuest3_80 = But anyway. Now to this wizard.
Fortress_MainQuest3_81 = He's a wierd little guy that lives in the mountains.
Fortress_MainQuest3_82 = When I summoned the hero who killed the dragon, he stole the fortress's keys.
Fortress_MainQuest3_83 = I don't know why, but he kept saying the keys were Talia, his wife.
Fortress_MainQuest3_84 = However, the hero managed to get them back and kill the dragon.  
Fortress_MainQuest3_85 = I sent him back, but I didn't notice he still had the keys until now.
Fortress_MainQuest3_86 = I... okay ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_87 = Anyway ! We have to hurry and deal with him. We can't let him have the orb.
Fortress_MainQuest3_88 = But how do we deal with the barrier ?
Fortress_MainQuest3_89 = I.. I know ! I can make a potion that will allow you to penetrate it.
Fortress_MainQuest3_90 = Let's see, do I have all the ingredients ? ....
Fortress_MainQuest3_91 = Herbs ? Yes. Pure rocks ? Yes. Ogre's nails ? Should be enough...
Fortress_MainQuest3_92 = Quartz ? .... Wait... Damn it ! I don't have any !
Fortress_MainQuest3_93 = [MC] ! You'll have to go to the mines and get some.
Fortress_MainQuest3_94 = I'll go home and start preparing the potions.
Fortress_MainQuest3_95 = Hurry, we don't have much time.
Fortress_MainQuest3_96 = Harold runs off. He's quite fast for his age.
Fortress_MainQuest3_97 = ... Let's go to the mines. I have to find some quartz.

Fortress_Barrier_1 = The barrier is protecting the fortress. I can't enter it like that.

Fortress_MainQuest5_1 = So... If I drink Harold's potion, I'll be able to enter the fortress...
Fortress_MainQuest5_2 = Well, here goes nothing.
Fortress_MainQuest5_3 = I drink the potion. It tastes sour.
Fortress_MainQuest5_4 = .....
Fortress_MainQuest5_5 = Did it do anything ? I just feel a little dizzy.
Fortress_MainQuest5_6 = Maybe I should just try to cross the barrier.
Fortress_MainQuest5_7 = I approach the barrier, it resonates with magic.
Fortress_MainQuest5_8 = ....
Fortress_MainQuest5_9 = I manage to cross it without problem.
Fortress_MainQuest5_10 = Harold sure know how to brew potions.
Fortress_MainQuest5_11 = Now, to enter the fortress and to find the orb.
Fortress_MainQuest5_12 = I open the door. Why was it left unlocked ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_13 = Well... At least it's easier for me.
Fortress_MainQuest5_14 = The fortress is a real maze.
Fortress_MainQuest5_15 = Every corridor and room are similar.
Fortress_MainQuest5_16 = I wonder if I'll even find the throne room.
Fortress_MainQuest5_17 = After searching for a bit, I manage to find it.
Fortress_MainQuest5_18 = It is gigantic. There is even a mountain of gold.
Fortress_MainQuest5_19 = Okay. Now I have to find the orb.
Fortress_MainQuest5_20 = Harold told me it would be hidden around here, but were ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_21 = The mountain of gold won't make this easy, too.
Fortress_MainQuest5_22 = I wonder where the wizard is. I haven't seen him at all.
Fortress_MainQuest5_23 = I'm here !!!
Fortress_MainQuest5_24 = Wha- ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_25 = The wizard appears in front of me. How did he do this ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_26 = You're too late ! I already found the orb !
Fortress_MainQuest5_27 = Impossible ! You can't use it, stop !
Fortress_MainQuest5_28 = Ah Ah ! I'll use it ! I'll use it !
Fortress_MainQuest5_29 = With it's power, I'll be able to create a portal to another world.
Fortress_MainQuest5_30 = Which world, you may ask ? Simple ! The world where my wife's kidnapper lives !
Fortress_MainQuest5_31 = I'll use the portal to go and save her.
Fortress_MainQuest5_32 = ... And destroy a few cities, just for fun.
Fortress_MainQuest5_33 = You're insane. I can't let you do this.
Fortress_MainQuest5_34 = Why not ?! You don't want me to save Talia ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_35 = I know ! You are a co-conspirator ! You are one of the kidnappers !
Fortress_MainQuest5_36 = What ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_37 = I'll kill you ! I'll avenge Talia !
Fortress_MainQuest5_38 = The wizard starts casting a powerful spell.
Fortress_MainQuest5_39 = I get ready for a fight.

Fortress_MainQuest5_40 = How did you dodge my rocks ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_41 = I know ! You're a cheater !
Fortress_MainQuest5_42 = Only a cheater can dodge my undodgable attacks !
Fortress_MainQuest5_43 = No ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_44 = But be careful ! This isn't my final form !
Fortress_MainQuest5_45 = I'll use the orb to destroy you !
Fortress_MainQuest5_46 = Wha- ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_47 = The wizard takes an orb out. Is it the chaos orb Harold told me about ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_48 = Ah Ah ! With this beauty, I'll be able to destroy you !
Fortress_MainQuest5_49 = The power of chaos will tear you appart, watch !
Fortress_MainQuest5_50 = The wizard is doing something with the orb, but what ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_51 = I have to act fast, who knows what will happen if he gets through with this.
Fortress_MainQuest5_52 = Ultimate destruction lazer !
Fortress_MainQuest5_53 = The orb starts pulsating. Quick !
Fortress_MainQuest5_54 = I run at the wizard and push him.
Fortress_MainQuest5_55 = Wh- ?!
Fortress_MainQuest5_56 = He falls to the ground and the orb is destabilized.
Fortress_MainQuest5_57 = It fires a beam. Luckily, not at me.
Fortress_MainQuest5_58 = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!
Fortress_MainQuest5_59 = Unfortunatly for the wizard, he wasn't as lucky as me.
Fortress_MainQuest5_60 = He gets vaporized by the beam.
Fortress_MainQuest5_61 = ....
Fortress_MainQuest5_62 = The orb fades away. Where did it go ?
Fortress_MainQuest5_63 = Well... At least nobody's going to use it now.
Fortress_MainQuest5_64 = I should report back to Harold. He'll want to hear what happened.
Fortress_MainQuest5_65 = I start heading to the fortress's entrance.
Fortress_MainQuest5_66 = Harold was right, the barrier is no longer here.
Fortress_MainQuest5_67 = Which means I can now exit this place, and meet up with him.
